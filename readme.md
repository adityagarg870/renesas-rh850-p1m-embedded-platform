# Renesas/RH850 - Embedded Platform Project

This repository demonstrates an automotive-grade embedded software platform developed on the Renesas RH850/P1M microcontroller family using the CS+ IDE.
The project showcases professional practices in driver development, safety supervision, task scheduling, and modular architecture, following AUTOSAR-inspired concepts.

üìÇ Project Structure
- `rh850-p1m-embedded-platform.mtpj` ‚Äì CS+ project file (open this to load the project in CS+ IDE).
-*.c, *.h, *.asm ‚Äì Source code and headers for drivers, tasks, safety monitoring, and system initialization.

README.md ‚Äì Project documentation.

LICENSE ‚Äì License information.

‚ú® Key Features

CAN Communication: Configured with TJA1145 transceiver for reliable in-vehicle networking.

SPI Master Drivers: Implemented CSIH0 and CSIG0 interfaces with CRC-6 error detection for robust peripheral communication.

Watchdog Manager (WdgM): Integrated periodic service routines to supervise tasks and ensure system safety.

Task Scheduler (SchM): Cooperative multi-rate scheduler executing 2 ms, 5 ms, and 10 ms tasks deterministically.

System Initialization: Modular bring-up of clocks, interrupts, and diagnostics for predictable ECU startup.

AUTOSAR-Inspired Architecture: Clear layering between Application, Scheduler, Drivers, and Hardware Abstraction for scalability and maintainability.

üîß Technical Highlights

~52,000 lines of code (including device headers).

~44% documentation coverage across source files.

34 source/header files organized by functional domain.

Modular structure aligned with AUTOSAR concepts (SchM, WdgM, Com stack layering).

Designed for reusability, scalability, and professional demonstration.
